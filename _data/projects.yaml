    We record brain activity of patients with implanted depth electrodes during attentional modeling tasks and determine regions of interest.
    We apply closed loop stimulation to regions of interest to disrupt behavior and identify underlying circuits responsible for social behaviors.

  description: 
    We perform neurobehavioral electrophysiology experiments with awake craniotomy patients, using novel high-density subdural microelectrodes.
    These experiments identify the topographical and spectral characteristics of neural signals relating to individual finger movement and somatosensation in primary hand sensorimotor cortex, as measured with a novel high-density (1024 channel) platinum nanorod thin-film microgrid.

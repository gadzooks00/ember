Dr. Raslan is a professor of neurological surgery, managing patients with a range of neurosurgical disorders. 
His practice focuses on epilepsy surgery; brain mapping for tumors and epilepsy, which often involves awake craniotomy; surgery for chronic and cancer pain (trigeminal neuralgia, spinal pain and many other chronic pain syndromes); hydrocephalus; and movement disorders.

Dr. Raslan's research focuses on cerebral cortical physiology and cognitive decoding. 
He is particularly focused on developing and testing newer high-resolution neural biointerfaces for the brain and spinal cord and decoding cognitive processes such as memory encoding, language and number cognition.
Additionally, he studies nociception (pain detection) and pain modulation, pathophysiology of trigeminal neuralgia, outcomes of functional neurosurgery, functional localization using intraoperative and extraoperative mapping, surgical education and operative efficiency.

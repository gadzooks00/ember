At the EMBER Lab, our research projects span a variety of disciplines, all with the goal of advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and neurosurgical care.
Our current work focuses on developing novel brain recording techniques and applying cutting-edge technology to improve patient outcomes.
Previous projects have laid the groundwork for new clinical methods, helping bridge the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical healthcare applications.
From exploratory research to clinical trials, our projects reflect a commitment to innovation, collaboration, and translational science.
